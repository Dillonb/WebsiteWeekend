The UVM Computer Science Crew (CS Crew) held its 4th semesterly peer advising night on April 4th.

E-mail invitations to undergraduates in the CS department and promises of pizza yielded a turnout of 23 students.  CS Juniors and Seniors offered their insights into the courses and the instructors teaching them.  Students were encouraged to engage their instructors and to take advantage of office hours offered by their instructors and the CS Crew.

We look forward to seeing all of the new faces in the CS Crew lab again.

The CS Crew would like to thank Chair Dinitz for the support he has given us to make this event possible.
