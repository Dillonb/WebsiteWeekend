This very site that you are reading this article on was created by the CS Crew in a weekend. Josh Dickerson, Ethan Eldridge, Scott MacEwan, Phelan Vander (sorry Phelan I don't know how to spell your name)...., and Garth Fritz cranked this site out. It was majestic.

The site was created using Josh's very own framework, JoshFrame. It was so easy to use all the other members had working modules in less than an hour. Having suffered with a generic UVM site for years the CS Crew members decided to add their own flair to the site the shows off their knowledge and design skills.

Creating the best CMS known to man-kind the Crew members revolutionized the way modern websites are created. "Its like everyone else is newbs,"  executive triumvirate member Ethan Eldridge exclaimed after starting work on his fifth module. "We are basically recreating the way the web works," star designer Phelan added.

It is obvious that everyone will be totally jealous of the site and will totally pay the CS Crew members tons of money to work on their sites. I know I would (I am definitely not a member of the CS Crew). It is a modern marvel, up there with the lunar landing and the invention of the transistor.

It is obvious that job offers will be flying into the Crew members' laps, if your a prospective CS student go join their club so you can get leet skillz also.
